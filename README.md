# Supplemental: MD-21-1246

This repository is provided as supplementary material to the article MD-21-1246, "Inverse Design Framework with Invertible Neural Networks for Passive Vibration Suppression in Phononic Structures". This supplemental contains the derivation of the Transfer Matrix Method, and the description of an approach that can be used to convert the transmissibility ratio to a query for the invertible neural networks (INN) and associated results.
